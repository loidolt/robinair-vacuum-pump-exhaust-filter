# Robinair Vacuum Pump Exhaust Filter

Simple adapter to allow the use of a foam pre-cleaner air filter (typically used on lawn mowers) on the exhaust of a Robinair Vacuum Pump.

This adapter should work will all of the Single Stage Robinair Vacuum Pumps, as they all use the same exhaust port. However, it is verified to work with a Robinair 15310 Vacumaster.

The air filter I used and verify to work are linked below. Any filter that replaces a Briggs Stratton 796031 should work great.

Print with 3 perimeters to ensure an airtight seal.
